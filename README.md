```

- **UI**: Web interface (Vite + TypeScript) with glassmorphism design and animated WebGL background
- **Orchestrator**: Node.js server controlling Playwright, running the agent loop, and managing state
- **Agent Loop**: OBSERVE → AUTO-RECOVERY → AUTO-SCROLL → DECIDE → ACT → VERIFY
- **LLM Integration**: Gemini 3 Flash for planning and decisions; Gemini 2.5 Flash for research synthesis and semantic scroll checks

## Features

### Planning & Intelligence
- **Pre-Planning Scout**: Verifies URLs via Google Search before planning (handles CAPTCHA detection)
- **LLM-Powered Planning**: Gemini 3 Flash decomposes tasks into atomic, executable steps
- **Task Classification**: Automatically categorizes tasks as Simple Action, Deep Research, or Transactional
- **Plan Fast-Forward**: After completing a step, automatically skips subsequent steps that are already accomplished (prevents redundant work when the agent moves faster than the plan)
- **Original Task Context**: The full user task is always passed to the LLM, ensuring multi-language prompts and search terms are preserved through the planning pipeline
- **Heuristic Fallback**: Works without API keys using rule-based decision making

### Resilience & Error Recovery
- **Graduated Failure Handling**: When the LLM returns no action, the agent tries SCROLL → WAIT → DONE instead of immediately giving up. Prevents premature task completion
- **Auto-Patch Malformed LLM Responses**: Missing `confidence` or `reasoning` fields are auto-filled with defaults, recovering valid actions that would otherwise be discarded
- **Already-Done Detection**: If the LLM can't decide but the current URL already satisfies the step objective, skips straight to DONE
- **Navigation Crash Protection**: Post-action state capture is wrapped in try-catch to survive page context destruction during cross-site navigation
- **SPA Retry for Region Detection**: When `scanPage()` finds 0 interactive elements on a real page, waits for network idle + 3s and retries once (handles React/SPA hydration delays on LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.)

### Smart Scrolling
- **Semantic Auto-Scroll**: Before asking the LLM what to do, a lightweight Gemini call checks if the target content is visible on the page. If not, the system scrolls automatically without burning a full LLM decision call.
- **Synonym-Aware**: Understands that "Dining" is relevant for "Food", "Catalog" for "Classes", etc.
- **Bottom Detection**: Stops scrolling when page content stops changing. Detects inner scroll containers (LinkedIn) and doesn't falsely declare "bottom reached" on unscrollable body elements.
- **Scroll Status Context**: The decision LLM is told what auto-scroll already did, preventing redundant scroll actions

### Auto-Recovery
- **Post-Fill Submit**: If filling a field doesn't trigger state change, automatically tries Enter, then searches for Submit/Search buttons, then asks the user

### Browser Interaction
- **Visual Click Actions**: Human-like cursor physics with bezier curve movement for natural interactions
- **DOM-Based Region Detection**: Finds all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, roles) with semantic `role` field (input, textarea, button, link, etc.) so the LLM can distinguish between elements with the same label
- **Expanded Page Context**: 4000 chars of visible page text sent to the LLM (up from 1500), ensuring content links on large pages are visible to the decision model
- **DOM Fallback Mode**: Uses Playwright role/name/selector fallbacks when region IDs become stale
- **Zombie Page Fix**: Tracks newest tab across pop-ups and navigations
- **Fast Stability Wait**: Optimized `waitForStability()` caps networkidle wait at 1.5s so noisy sites (Amazon, YouTube) don't stall the agent

### Research & Synthesis
- **Research Notes Accumulation**: After each objective completes, extracts visible page text and stores it as a research note. Accumulated notes are passed to subsequent steps for context continuity.
- **LLM-Powered Synthesis**: For research-type tasks (find, compare, recommend, etc.), after all objectives complete, Gemini synthesizes a concise answer from all collected notes and sends it to the UI
- **Task-Aware Gating**: Synthesis only runs for research tasks with meaningful notes, avoiding junk output on simple navigation tasks

### Safety & Control
- **Guardrails**: Domain allowlisting, sensitive field protection (passwords, SSN, API keys), risky action confirmation
- **User Confirmation Flows**: ASK_USER (manual action needed) and CONFIRM (permission required) pause types
- **Anti-Hallucination Rules**: LLM is instructed to only use fill values explicitly stated in the task, never invent them

### Observability
- **Real-Time Streaming**: WebSocket streaming of screenshots and step logs to the UI
- **Persistent Logging**: SQLite database for sessions, steps, actions, and observations
- **DB-Backed Memory**: Short-term history (last 5 actions) fed to LLM for context awareness
- **Artifact Storage**: Screenshots and JSON trace files saved per session

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Playwright Chromium:**
   ```bash
   npm run playwright:install
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env .env.local
   # Edit with your settings
   ```

   Key environment variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here        # Required for LLM planning and decisions
   START_URL=https://www.google.com/
   ALLOWED_DOMAINS=example.com,localhost,google.com
   BROWSER_HEADLESS=false
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. **Run development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts:
   - Orchestrator on port 3001 (HTTP + WebSocket at /ws)
   - UI dev server on port 5173 (Vite)

5. **Open the UI:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Enter a task in the UI (e.g., "Go to YouTube and search for OpenAI demos")
2. Click "Execute" to start
3. Watch the agent work:
   - Screenshots stream to the UI in real-time
   - Neural log shows every phase and decision
   - Auto-scroll finds content before the LLM is even called
   - If confirmation or manual action is needed, a modal appears
   - For research tasks, a synthesis of findings is displayed at the end

**Example tasks:**
- "Search for 'ChatGPT' on Google and click the first result"
- "Go to YouTube and search for OpenAI demos"
- "Find 红尘客栈 李幸倪 on YouTube and click the video" (multi-language support)
- "Find the current menu for Umi restaurant at UCSD"
- "Research the best 4K monitors under $500" (deep research — visits multiple sources, synthesizes findings)
- "Navigate to Canvas and check my grades" (triggers auth flow)

**User Confirmation:**
- **ASK_USER**: Requires manual action (e.g., login, MFA, CAPTCHA, payment)
- **CONFIRM**: Asks permission before risky actions (submit, delete, pay, enroll)
